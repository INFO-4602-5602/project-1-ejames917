INFO 4602 Project #1

Collaborated with Josh Griffiths, Jamie Ackerson, and Cole Gendelman.

I referenced examples from http://www.bl.ocks.org/d3noob and StackOverflow to implement Parts 4 & 5, along with the Tooltips bell. 

I also adapted code from StackOverflow to be able to sort the data points to plot properly. It can be seen on line 156, as well as in all following calls of d3.csv(). It calls the JavaScript function .sort() to order the values of the data. The function which is called as an argument to .sort() decides the order in which the data is organized; in this case, the x values of the data are sorted in ascending order.
